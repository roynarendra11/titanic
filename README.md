**AIM**: Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics

 __Datasets__: Train.csv and Test.csv from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/francksylla/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster/data) are being used for the problem statement

__Methods Used__: I am planning to use the following techniques:
1.  Logistic Regression
2.  Decision Tree
3.  SVM
4.  Naive Bayes
5.  LDA & QDA

### __Data Dictionary__:

#### *VariableDefinitionKey* 
survival Survival 0 = No, 1 = Yes pclass Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd sex Sex Age Age in years sibsp # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic parch # of parents / children aboard the Titanic ticket Ticket number fare Passenger fare cabin Cabin number embarked Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

#### *Variable Notes*

__pclass__: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

__age__: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

__sibsp__: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
__Sibling__ = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
__Spouse__ = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

__parch__: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
__Parent__ = mother, father
__Child__ = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
